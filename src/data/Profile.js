      text:"Breast cancer is the leading cause of mortality among women in Ecuador, with 3,903 cases and 1,154 deaths recorded in 2022. This means that approximately 1 in 3 cases results in death. Globally, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases annually. To address this issue, a predictive model has been proposed, utilizing key tumor characteristics—such as radius, texture, perimeter, and area—obtained through diagnostic tests like mammograms, ultrasounds, and MRIs. This approach aims to improve accuracy in differentiating between benign and malignant tumors, supporting doctors in data-driven decision-making.",

      title: "Boost Your Learning with Artificial Intelligence",
      text:"In this talk, I explored the power of Artificial Intelligence in transforming the learning experience. I started by explaining how AI tools can be used to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of personal study routines. A key focus was on creating tailored learning paths, helping learners set clear goals and break them down into manageable steps, using AI-driven systems. Furthermore, I discussed the various AI platforms available and how each can be optimized for specific tasks, highlighting the strengths and use cases of each tool. By incorporating real-world examples, I showed how to use AI prompts to streamline the process of learning complex topics, such as programming. Finally, the talk emphasized the adaptability of AI in addressing individual learning needs, making it possible to personalize educational experiences based on the learner's unique goals and preferences.",
